An API key obtained from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.rss.com/api-access/) is required for authentication."},"servers":[{"url":"/"}],"security":[{"X-Api-Key":[]}],"tags":[{"name":"Assets","description":"The **Assets** endpoints let you upload media files like images and audio for your podcasts and episodes.\n\nUploads are performed through [AWS presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html), which allow you to send files directly and securely to storage.\n\nThe flow is simple:\n1. Request a presigned URL — you’ll get back the upload URL and an identifier.\n2. Upload your file to the given URL.\n3. Use the identifier to link that asset to a resource, such as an episode."},{"name":"Categories","description":"The **Categories** endpoints give you access to the set of categories available for your podcasts. Each podcast can be assigned a primary and secondary category to help classify its content and improve discoverability on podcast platforms."},{"name":"Collaborators","description":"The **Collaborators** endpoints let you invite people, whether they are existing RSS.com users or new users, to collaborate on a podcast within your network.\n\nWhen you send an invitation, the recipient receives an email notification and must accept the invite through their own RSS.com dashboard before gaining access.\n\nCollaborators can be assigned different roles, allowing you to control each person's level of access and permissions within the podcast. A collaborator with the **admin** role can manage everything related to the podcast except other collaborators. A collaborator with the **analyst** role has read-only access and can view podcast analytics only. At the moment, podcast analytics are only available through the RSS.com dashboard."},{"name":"Episodes","description":"The **Episodes** endpoints let you create and manage the episodes within your podcasts. You can use these endpoints to publish new episodes, update their details, or remove them when necessary.\n\nEpisodes typically include both images and audio files. For everything related to uploading and referencing these assets, see the **Assets** section for details on how to handle media securely. If an episode does not have its own cover image, it will automatically inherit the podcast's cover.\n\nBefore an episode can be published, it must complete asynchronous processing — specifically, audio transcoding. The status of these background processes is available in the `processing` property.\n\nAn episode can be published as soon as the processing completes by scheduling it at the current timestamp or at any timestamp in the past."},{"name":"Keywords","description":"The **Keywords** endpoints allow you to create and manage optional keywords for your podcast. These keywords can be attached to episodes to help you organize or categorize your content. **They are not currently used for discovery**, but they may support additional features in the future. Feel free to use them if they're helpful, there's no need to overthink or overuse them."},{"name":"Locations","description":"The **Locations** endpoints give you access to the set of locations available for your podcasts. These locations can be assigned to both podcasts and episodes to add geographical context."},{"name":"Podcasts","description":"The **Podcast** endpoints let you create and manage the podcasts that belong to your network. You can use these endpoints to set up new podcasts, update existing ones, or remove those that are no longer needed.\n\nFor everything related to media uploads (such as podcast cover images), see the **Assets** section for details on how to upload and reference files securely."}],"components":{"responses":{"ValidationError":{"description":"Bad Request","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ValidationError"}}}},"UnauthorizedError":{"description":"Unauthorized","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/UnauthorizedError"}}}},"PaymentRequiredError":{"description":"Payment Required","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/PaymentRequiredError"}}}},"ForbiddenError":{"description":"Forbidden","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ForbiddenError"}}}},"NotFoundError":{"description":"Not found","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/NotFoundError"}}}},"InternalServerError":{"description":"Internal Server Error","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/InternalServerError"}}}}},"securitySchemes":{"X-Api-Key":{"type":"apiKey","name":"X-Api-Key","in":"header"}},"schemas":{"ValidationError":{"type":"object","properties":{"status":{"type":"number","enum":[400]},"form_errors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"A list of errors related to the overall request body, not associated with any specific field"},"field_errors":{"type":"object","properties":{},"description":"A map of field-specific validation errors.
