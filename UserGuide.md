## Tips for Success

### Planning Your First Episode

1. **Start Simple**: Don't worry about getting everything perfect
2. **Add People First**: Set up your hosts and guests before creating segments
3. **Break It Down**: Divide your episode into 3-7 segments for good structure
4. **Estimate Generously**: Add a few extra minutes to each segment estimate
5. **Use Key Points**: They help you stay on track during recording

### During Recording

1. **Review Segments First**: Before starting, look through all your segments in the Go Live tab
2. **Use the Timer**: Start it when you begin each segment, stop it when you finish
3. **Take Notes**: Write down anything unusual or important that happens
4. **Don't Stress Over Time**: The color coding helps, but natural conversation matters more
5. **Save As You Go**: The app auto-saves, but use "Save & Next" between segments

### Best Practices

1. **Back Up Your Work**: Export to JSON after planning each episode
2. **Use Assets Wisely**: Track physical items you need, special locations, or important props
3. **Assign People Early**: Knowing who's in each segment helps with preparation
4. **Color Code Consistently**: Use similar colors for similar roles across episodes
5. **Review Your Stats**: After recording, check your actual time vs. estimated time to improve future planning
6. **Collapse Sections**: Use the +/- icons to collapse sections you're not currently using - especially helpful on mobile devices

### Mobile-Specific Tips

1. **Collapse Unused Sections**: Tap the − icon next to section titles to minimize scrolling
2. **Use Portrait Mode**: The app works better in portrait orientation on phones
3. **Zoom if Needed**: Pinch to zoom on specific areas if text is too small
4. **Save Frequently**: Mobile browsers can reload pages unexpectedly - export to JSON often
5. **Consider Using Desktop**: For complex episodes with many segments, a larger screen makes planning easier

## Troubleshooting

### My data disappeared
- Check if you accidentally clicked "Clear All Data"
- Data is stored in your browser - clearing browser data will delete everything
- Always export to JSON to back up important episodes

### Can't drag segments
- Make sure you're clicking and holding the **≡** icon (not the segment itself)
- Try using a mouse instead of a trackpad
- On mobile: Drag-and-drop may not work well - consider using a desktop
- Refresh the page if the drag feature stops working

### Mobile warning keeps appearing
- Click "Continue Anyway" to dismiss it
- Your choice is saved and won't show again unless you clear browser data
- The warning appears because the app works best on larger screens

### Exports not working
- **PDF**: Use the print dialog to save as PDF
- **JPG**: Make sure the page has fully loaded before exporting
- **JSON**: Check that your browser allows file downloads

### Timer issues
- If the timer doesn't start, refresh the page
- Make sure you clicked "Start" (not just "Pause")
- The timer only saves when you click "Stop" (not "Pause")

### Sections won't collapse/expand
- Make sure you're clicking on the section header (not inside the content)
- Look for the +/− icon on the left side of section titles
- Refresh the page if the feature stops working

### Something else not working?
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache
- Try a different browser
- If using mobile, try a tablet or desktop for better experience
